<h1 style="padding-top: 25px;">Hi! I'm Yvonne</h1>

I am a design leader with 17+ years of experience, specialized in the worlds of UX, digital platforms, product design, and service design. I enjoy solving meaty problems, being deeply rooted in customer empathy, and elevating individuals, teams, and design craft to help drive user desire and business outcomes.

In my free time, I enjoy any kind of family activity, especially through the lens of my 2 small kids. I also enjoy cooking, writing, photography, and hand lettering.
