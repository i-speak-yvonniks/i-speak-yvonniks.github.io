Lots of people are looking for work

I have not found much success in:

*   Connecting directly with the dedicated team recruiter
    
*   Connecting directly to hiring manager
    
*   Networking
    
*   Sharing breadth over depth
    

I have found more success in:

*   Third party/ agency recruiters
    
*   People who have worked with me 10+ years ago remembering me
    
*   Hyper focusing on one showcase case study
    

*   Third party recruiters will actually help get your foot in the door
