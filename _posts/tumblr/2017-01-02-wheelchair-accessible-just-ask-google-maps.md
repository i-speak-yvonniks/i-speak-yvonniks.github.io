[Wheelchair accessible? Just ask Google Maps](http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2016/1219/Wheelchair-accessible-Just-ask-Google-Maps)  

Similar to [AXS Map](https://www.axsmap.com/), Google Maps is relying on crowdsourcing to indicate which hotspots and locations are wheelchair-accessible. It’s currently US only, but it’ll be really neat to see how fast this will expand to other countries.

Spreading accessibility awareness and creating/ allowing access for all starts with you!&nbsp;

> “The search giant has launched a new feature through Google Maps that lists whether a location is wheelchair-accessible. Available only in the US to start, the feature relies on users to answer questions about the accessibility of a place they visit.
> 
> The new feature could impact millions of people in the United States. There are [2.2 million people](https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/rehabtech/conditioninfo/Pages/people.aspx) in the US who depend on a wheelchair, according to The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the information could also assist users who rely on walkers, canes, or crutches, of which there are another 6.5 million people in the US, as well as mothers with strollers.”
