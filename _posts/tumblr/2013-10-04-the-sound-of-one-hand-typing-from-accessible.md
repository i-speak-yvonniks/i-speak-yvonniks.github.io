[The sound of one hand typing: from accessible design to universal design | UXconference 2013](http://www.uxcon.com/blog/2013/the-sound-of-one-hand-typing-from-accessible-design-to-universal-design/?goback=%2Egde_1854192_member_278011859#%21)  

> The typing experience may be only a small part of this, but understanding the basics of universal design will help designers to create a healthier world.

Wish I could attend something like this. It’s always fun to hear others’ perspectives and ideas on accessibility and universal design. I’m especially interested in learning more about one-hand typing.&nbsp;
