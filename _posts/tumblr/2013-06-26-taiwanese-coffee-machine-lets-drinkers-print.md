[Taiwanese coffee machine lets drinkers print selfies onto lattes | Digital Trends](http://www.digitaltrends.com/international/taiwanese-coffee-machine-lets-drinkers-print-selfies-onto-lattes/)  

> A coffee chain in Taiwan has developed a machine that not only makes coffee but also lets you print a photo of yourself on the foam. Edible brown powder has never looked so amazing.

Drinking a selfie is weird to me, but I would totally drink up a Keroppi or Hello Kitty.&nbsp;
