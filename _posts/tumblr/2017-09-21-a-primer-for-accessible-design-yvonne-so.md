[A Primer for Accessible Design – Yvonne So – Medium](https://medium.com/@yvonniks/a-primer-for-accessible-design-9c53a0054f7f)  

I just published a quick primer around foundations for accessible design on Medium. I hope this will help designers, developers, product managers, etc. to get kickstarted with understanding how to design and create inclusive user experiences.&nbsp;&nbsp;

I also know it may seem like a mountainous task to tackle accessibility during the design and development process, especially in large teams working on complex features or products with tight deadlines, and often times it results in making tradeoffs and compromises. However, if we relentlessly aim to follow some core foundational principles, we can improve lives in ways we may not have thought possible.&nbsp;
