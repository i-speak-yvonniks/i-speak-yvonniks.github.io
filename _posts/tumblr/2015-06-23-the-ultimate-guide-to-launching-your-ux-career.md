[The ultimate guide to launching your UX career](http://thenextweb.com/dd/2015/06/17/the-ultimate-guide-to-launching-your-ux-career/)  

This excerpt here is spot on. IxD, VsD, Content Strategy, IA, UI are all subsets of UX.&nbsp;

- **UX design** — User experience is all about designing the complete product experience. UX requires an understanding of psychology, sociology and design in order to identify the right user problems. The field also requires tactical skills, such as user research, concept iteration, prototyping and usability testing. Sub-disciplines include interaction design, visual design, UI design, information architecture, and content strategy.
- **UI design** — UI designers create the tangible interfaces that users can see and feel. The field intersects quite a bit with UX design since you must understand the larger experiential context for every interface detail. In small companies, UI designers may own the entire process from defining user flows to refining high-fidelity mockups. In larger companies, they’ll likely specialize more in strategizing the layout of the site or app (sketching, wireframing, etc.).
