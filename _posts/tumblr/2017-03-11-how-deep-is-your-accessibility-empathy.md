**WHY SHOULD I CARE?**   
15% of the world’s population (approximately one billion people) experience some form of disability, and each of us will likely encounter some form of disability in our lives. Keep in mind while some of us may experience temporary disabilities, understand that many live with a disability 24/7. There are many different types of disabilities, such as vision, movement, thinking, remembering, learning, communicating, hearing, mental health, social relationships, etc.

**LAWS AND REGULATIONS**  
Much of the information technology we know and see today requires legal compliance. Many regulations, laws, and guidelines have been implemented over the years to enforce accessibility.  
  
[The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)](http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ada.gov%2Fada_intro.htm&t=ZWI2MGQ1YzE3NmNjMGFkMTZlOWFmMzY2ZjVkMjk0MWM4ODQwOTM2ZSxuSzEyOEZ4Vw%3D%3D&b=t%3AtvKoXdtai9UpRNvqFscTVA&p=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.yvonniks.com%2Fpost%2F131054760216%2Fghc15-accessible-design&m=1) prohibited discrimination against people with disabilities. This act was implemented before the Internet was commonplace for people to communicate/ get information.   
  
[Section 508](http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwebaim.org%2Fstandards%2F508%2Fchecklist&t=YTk5MzRhZjdhZmZjNzkxNzI0M2NhMDA3NWM1OTkwNGU5NGZlZGVkMyxuSzEyOEZ4Vw%3D%3D&b=t%3AtvKoXdtai9UpRNvqFscTVA&p=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.yvonniks.com%2Fpost%2F131054760216%2Fghc15-accessible-design&m=1) is an amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which requires all electronic information presented by federal or government agencies to be accessible to people with disabilities.

Australia, Ireland, and UK has laws against disability discrimination. The British Standards Institute issued a [Code of Practice for Web Accessibility](http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.access8878.co.uk%2F&t=YWY4MGFhMDhjYTQ4MDc3NmViMTZmZWJhNDQ1YjU5YzlmNTdjMWQyOCxuSzEyOEZ4Vw%3D%3D&b=t%3AtvKoXdtai9UpRNvqFscTVA&p=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.yvonniks.com%2Fpost%2F131054760216%2Fghc15-accessible-design&m=1) in 2010.

**WHY EMPATHY?**   
[In this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Evwgu369Jw), Brene Brown briefly discusses the difference between empathy and sympathy. As creative technologists of the future, in a rapidly advancing digital world, we have the power to change the course of how we interact with interfaces and emerging technologies to be more inclusive of everyone.   
  
In order to think of or provide innovative solutions for customer pain, we must first understand the pains that people with disabilities may face in the digital space, beyond today.

Apple did a great job with a video on their website and accessibility page [showcasing a few of their accessibility features](http://www.apple.com/accessibility/). I encourage you to play around with the features to experience how other might use the features and perhaps even enhance your own workflow and device experience. &nbsp;

W3C also launched a series of [Web Accessibility Perspectives Videos](https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspectives/), which offer a glimpse into how what you do from now on, design or development-wise, can have a significant impact on the lives of people with specific disabilities. &nbsp;

**GET DEEPLY ROOTED IN EMPATHY**   
Here are some resources to get your more deeply rooted in customer empathy. Don’t lose the empathy after this workshop - remember to keep practicing empathy! &nbsp;
