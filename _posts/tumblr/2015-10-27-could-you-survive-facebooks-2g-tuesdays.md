[Could You Survive Facebook's 2G Tuesdays?](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2493961,00.asp)  

This is a fantastic idea! What a great way to drive customer empathy.&nbsp;

Every Tuesday, Facebook employees downgrade their cell phone connection to 2G connection to get a taste of what it’s like to use their product under what we would think of extremely limited conditions.&nbsp;

We basically live in a bubble in the bay area where everyone has top-tier devices, fast Internet connection, we’re connected all the time. It’s hard to just stop and think to appreciate what non-silicon-valley users experience.&nbsp;

This especially speaks to me as my team is currently working on uncovering global business strategies and coming up with design explorations for responsive/ mobile-optimized/ embedded web UI.&nbsp;
