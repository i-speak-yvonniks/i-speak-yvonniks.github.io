Today we said farewell to our long time (11 years!) CEO of Intuit, Brad Smith. Although I feel so far removed from him on a personal and professional level, or any life level really, he is such a respected leader not only at the company, but within the industry, and perhaps globally. Brad truly understands what it means to be a leader, always displays empathy and compassion, can be humorous, has figured out how to make people love him, and he speaks with such charisma, a trait I unfortunately do not have and may never reach, but I most certainly admire!&nbsp;

During the farewell fireside chat, Brad talked about how his job wasn’t easy, but it was easy compared to the most difficult job in the world: **being a mother**. He read aloud a poem he wrote for his wife years ago, and it was such a nice ode to all the working mothers at Intuit. As a new mother figuring myself out as well as how I want my child to be raised, I personally was moved by the poem and wanted to immediately call my mom to praise her, tell her how much she means to me and our family, and that no matter how I stressed out I must feel, it can’t possibly compare to the 30+ years so far of stress she’s endured from me and my sister. ;)&nbsp;

This was the post with the poem from Brad’s wife on FB on Mother’s Day:

Since it is Mother’s Day, I’d like to share a poem that my husband, Brad, wrote for me 15 years ago when I was facing a difficult decision – whether I would continue practicing as an attorney (a profession I really enjoyed), or stay at home to spend more time with my two girls. Every family is not blessed with having such a choice, as two incomes are often required to make ends meet, but regardless of whether there is the luxury of a choice, or what decision is ultimately made, Brad’s response to my question of whether my life could be fulfilled by being “Just A Mother” led to his writing this piece. The poem means as much to me today as it did at that time. Happy Mother’s Day to all the other “Just Mothers” out there. I hope you enjoy the poem.

“Just A Mother” – by Brad Smith (September 1999)

The value one contributes is measured carefully,  
It’s quantified and counted to measure legacy.  
The fear she harbors deep inside is the judgment of another,  
After all, her contribution is that she is just a mother.

The children, rushed and hurried, choose heroes to admire,  
Some strong, some fast, all valiant – when situations are dire.  
“How can she measure up to that?”- she sits aside and ponders,  
She has to be more worthy than simply just a mother.

The hours can be long and dark when friendships become few.  
It is a lonely journey when dreams are not pursued.  
The passions she held yesterday, she struggles now to smother,  
For there’s no time for “I” or “me” when you are just a mother.

Tomorrow’s greatest treasures are well upon their way,  
To building higher castles than can be found today.  
A sister with her sister, like me and all my brothers,  
Were taught life’s greatest lessons by simply just a mother.

To view such selfless sacrifice does humble all who see,  
That all the things we do each day just will not ever be  
As a great a contribution as one who lives for others,  
As one who gives her best each day to simply be a mother.

So when the dust is settled, and all the tallies done,  
The ones, who’ll do the counting, are the ones who came forth from  
Her sacrifice and selflessness, and that is why we love her…  
There are no heroes, great or small, more grand than “Just A Mother”
