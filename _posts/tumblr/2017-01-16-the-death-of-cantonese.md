[The death of Cantonese?](https://www.timeout.com/hong-kong/blog/the-death-of-cantonese-050816)  

Oh noes!!!&nbsp;

It saddens me to know that I will basically be a key contributor to the death of my dialect. :( &nbsp;

I may speak and understand Cantonese, but because I was born and raised in America, my native tongue is English. I count in English. My thoughts are in English. If I speak Cantonese, I feel I have to use 100% brain capacity and fully concentrate on what needs to be said.&nbsp;My future children will only be able to pick up a snippet of what I can speak, if they can even understand it at all. Their future is bleak when it comes to learning Cantonese or Mandarin.&nbsp;

Apology for now and later:   
Dear mom and dad, I am so deeply sorry I have failed you.&nbsp;

Some random thoughts:   
I wonder if there is some sort of technology workaround in trying to pass the language on to future generations. I could envision Alexa to translate everything I say into Chinese and speak it aloud. It would take away from the act of having a proper conversation, though, if it just means repeating the same phrasesâ€¦ &nbsp;
