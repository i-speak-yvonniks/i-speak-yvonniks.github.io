[Engineering our Design Teams](http://www.uxbooth.com/articles/engineering-our-design-teams/)  

> UX designers learn from users and stakeholders in every project - but what can they learn from engineers? This week author Yvonne So brings us through five steps of the Agile process, and translates engineering practices into the design realm.&nbsp;

Thank you UX Booth for allowing me the opportunity to write as a contributing author!&nbsp;
