[Apple's newest feature is something you've probably never thought about before](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/apple-iphone-ipad-accessibility-macbook-pro-mac-disability-apple-watch-a7492226.html?platform=hootsuite)  

I wanted to post this to highlight the video, not just Apple. Watch the video! The storytelling was so nicely done to highlight inclusive design without having to dive deep into individual use cases or experiences, which to me is a representation of how a small or simple feature (that we may take for granted or&nbsp;just didn’t know could exist) can improve many people’s lives so profoundly.&nbsp;

Apple also updated their accessibility website, which showcases video snippets of existing built-in features, reinforcing the overarching storytelling in the main video. Designing new technology is about designing for everyone- not just a specific set of users.&nbsp;

I think this speaks volumes for how far accessibility awareness and inclusive design has come, and I want to call out how powerful storytelling can be when it comes to building awareness and marketing new technology. &nbsp;
