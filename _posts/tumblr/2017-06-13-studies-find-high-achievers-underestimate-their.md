“The trick is to not be fooled by illusions of superiority and to learn to accurately reevaluate our competence. After all, as Confucius reportedly said, real knowledge is knowing the extent of one’s ignorance.”

Who else has insecurities about themselves regarding life and career? Lately I’ve had a lot of self-doubt about myself, and I sometimes tend to go down an emotional path feeling I’m not worthy of anything or suffer from major imposter syndrome. Then I tell my mind to shut up and stop. We often need to remind ourselves that we have skills, we’re high achievers, we’re smart, awesome, and beautiful.&nbsp;

“Pour yourself a drink, put on some lipstick, and pull yourself together.”&nbsp;
