[Printables For 2016 Reflection & 2017 Planning](https://thehappinessplanner.com/pages/printables-for-2016-reflection-2017-planning)  

Happy new year!!&nbsp;

As 2016 comes to a close, it’s time to welcome 2017.&nbsp;

2016 has been a productive year for me, with lots of highs individually (traveled a ton, submitted some papers, got LASIK, got married, planned a wedding, PR’d my deadlift weight), but lots of lows from a societal standpoint (i.e. US Presidential Election, Brexit, etc.). That’s ok, though. If we continue to better ourselves and help bring others up, always striving to be better than who we were yesterday, then together we can become a better society, creating a better world and future.&nbsp;

At work, we’re in the midst of mid-year reviews and 360 feedback. I think these printable reflection sheets would be a timely and fun exercise for our team. I’m going to pitch it to my manager so that we can take time filling them out during one of our team meetings. It would be a treat if we all hung on to them and then reflected upon the sheets in 2018! &nbsp;&nbsp;
