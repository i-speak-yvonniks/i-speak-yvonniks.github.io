I know I’ve been posting a lot about Chinese language and culture lately, but since it’s nearing Chinese New Year, I wanted to post this timely and heartwarming video about the culture and traditions instilled within me that I often take for granted.&nbsp;

My tears are flowing!! I am such a terrible daughter as I rarely go home for Chinese New Year, I am sure I’ve forgotten to call home a few times, and watching this video just makes me overwhelmingly appreciative of how much my parents try to pass down important traditions to their ungrateful children, not fully understanding why things must be a certain way until we’re older. &nbsp;

Going to call my mom now…&nbsp;
