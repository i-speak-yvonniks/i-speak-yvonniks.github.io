[Nellie Bly: Google Doodle’s 1st original song (Karen O) salutes an American original](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2015/05/05/nellie-bly-google-doodles-1st-original-song-karen-o-salutes-an-american-original/)  

Today I learned about Nellie Bly, who was a pioneering journalist in the late 1800s and an inspiration to so many in future generations.&nbsp;  
  
From the article:&nbsp;  
  
Bly “grew up without privilege or higher education, knowing that her greatest asset was the force of her own will … ,” Kroeger writes in her 1994 biography, [“Nellie Bly: Daredevil, Reporter, Feminist.”](http://www.amazon.com/Nellie-Bly-Daredevil-Reporter-Feminist/dp/0812925254)   
  
“As the most famous woman journalist of her day, as an early woman industrialist, as a humanitarian, even as a beleaguered litigant, Bly kept the same formula for success: Determine Right. Decide Fast. Apply Energy. Act With Conviction. Fight to the Finish. Accept the Consequences. Move on.”&nbsp;  
  
Thank you for reminding me that no matter what gender I am or classification I’m labeled, where there is a will, there is a way.&nbsp;
