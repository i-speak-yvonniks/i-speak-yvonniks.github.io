[5 Design Jobs That Won't Exist In The Future](https://www.fastcodesign.com/3063318/5-design-jobs-that-wont-exist-in-the-future)  

So I guess I’ll likely be out of a job in a few years…&nbsp;

It is strange to start thinking about my future in this way as it feels like just yesterday I was younger, bright eyed, and admiring my older peers and managers, and that&nbsp;“getting older” was so so far away..&nbsp;

Anyway, maybe I’ll open up a coffee shop? Or a a shop that just sells scones? Baker? Dance instructor? Or maybe people would actually want to pay me to help plan their wedding?! Yea?&nbsp;
