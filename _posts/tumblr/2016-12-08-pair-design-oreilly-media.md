[Pair Design - O'Reilly Media](http://www.oreilly.com/design/free/pair-design.csp)  

As you probably already know, I am a huge fan and proponent for pair designing (the design equivalent of pair programming). Two heads are always better than one. My friend, Philip, sent me this link to a free e-book, which includes case studies and examples of ways to collaborate.&nbsp;

Here’s a quick snippet I liked that helps sum up why pair designing is very much needed when brainstorming and executing ideas:&nbsp;

“Can a single designer just take on generating and synthesizing as tasks to be done? Does it need to be two people? Possibly, but it’s not easy. When you come up with an idea, you come up with it for good reasons and are working with a built-in confirmation bias that tells you that your idea is good because it is yours. Synthing your own work fairly takes some superhuman capabilities to overcome that bias. And your experience as an individual might not be as equipped to provide a counterexample as another person with an entirely different set of experiences.”
