As a UX designer watching this video, I feel the title of this should really be **product design vs. consulting**.&nbsp;

A lot of young designers and new grads often ask me to compare my experience at agencies and consulting firms versus my experience in-house. While I found both of those paths to be very enriching to how my career has panned out so far, I think this video of Steve Jobs explaining his POV on the difference is a great way to describe my experiences. This explanation is also great food for thought for designers to dig deep within and understand what it is they want to do and accomplish at a particular moment in time. What you are doing now certainly doesnâ€™t define who you are or who you will become.&nbsp;&nbsp;
