[Designing for Mobile Apps: Overall Principles, Common Patterns, and Interface Guidelines](https://goo.gl/kfVif2)  

I recently wrote an article on Intuitâ€™s BLUEprint publication around the fundamentals, patterns, and guidelines when designing for native mobile apps. I hope this is a good primer and starting point for designers, product managers, content writers, engineers who are either new to mobile design or are looking to better understand some common best practices and trends around mobile app design and development.&nbsp;

BLUEprint by Intuit is a publication comprised of thoughts from Intuit on technology, data, design, org culture, and innovation.&nbsp;
