The LightHouse for the Blind and Visually Impaired in SF is hosting a lunch open house event: “See Your Designs Through Someone Else’s Eyes, A New Virtual Reality Experience.”&nbsp;

“On May 18, LightHouse for the Blind invites designers and planners to move beyond metaphors and look at the world a little differently.” You can go and experience the new VR and AR technology that allows you to view work through the eyes of a blind or visually impaired person. &nbsp;
